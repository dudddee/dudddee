- Hey, if you happened to come across my readme, I’m @dudddee
I imagine this first line is kind of a commonplace, so i will keep it simple like that

So, the thing is, I just started learning Python, more accurately, an hour ago

I've just created a virtual environment in my VScode and started to study using Learn Python the Hard Way
Some professors in my uni recommended it, but I don't know if it is as effective as it could be, it seems very strict

Please, if you have any good source material for an absolute begginer like me, don't hesitate to tell me in any way
(have no idea how direct communication works in github, but i can learn it)

Anyways, i expect to create awesome things around here, especially in my graduation area, which is ✨biotechnology✨
I've put all my chips in this area, cus i think renewable energy, genetic manipulation and assisted evolution are the future
Hope to get to know some of you and contribute to your projects as much as you might help me, to the full extent of my capacities
That's all for now!
