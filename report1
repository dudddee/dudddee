So, hey \n
i've made some more exercises \n
maybe i should upload them, i'll do it \n
\n
i'm kind of getting how things work with strings \n
all that stuff with "{}" and .format() is very nice \n
being able to make placeholders should make me able to maybe store things in a sentence that could be changed
in a single variable or array and start substituting them using code \n
that sounds fun\n
\n
that's about it for now\n
i'll upload the files, though i lost some of them and won't do them again
