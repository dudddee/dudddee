So, hey
i've made some more exercises
maybe i should upload them, i'll do it

i'm kind of getting how things work with strings
all that stuff with "{}" and .format() is very nice
being able to make placeholders should make me able to maybe store things in a sentence that could be changed
in a single variable or array and start substituting them using code
that sounds fun

that's about it for now
i'll upload the files, though i lost some of them and won't do them again
