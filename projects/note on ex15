ok
learned about 2 new functions, open() and read()
basically they open the possibility of crawling into other .txt files (maybe other types but i'm not sure)

suppose a file.txt file

if i get the name of the file by input or argv i can store it
filename = input() --> gets the name of the file (is the name stored in a string?)
txt = open(filename) --> opens the file of given name and stores the content in txt
print(txt.read()) --> reads the text inside txt and prints it out

this is actually crazy
