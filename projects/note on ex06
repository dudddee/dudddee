ok

i didn't figure out still how .format() works

the new thing is, {} inside a string acts as a placeholder, right?

storing a string inside a variable and giving it a placeholder let's me substitute that placeholder

then, what i understand is, if i attach .format(x) to the variable, the placeholder gets substituted by x
