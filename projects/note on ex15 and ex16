ok
learned about 2 new functions, open() and read()
basically they open the possibility of crawling into other .txt files (maybe other types but i'm not sure)

suppose a file.txt file

if i get the name of the file by input or argv i can store it
filename = input() --> gets the name of the file (is the name stored in a string?)
txt = open(filename) --> opens the file of given name and stores the content in txt
print(txt.read()) --> reads the text inside txt and prints it out

this is actually crazy

NEW
the parameter 'w' in open function opens the file in writing mode, which truncates it (deletes content) and leaves it open
then, i can write in it with the .write method, which takes just 1 parameter
